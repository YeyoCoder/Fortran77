# Numerical Analysis 2018  
  
This repo contain the programs of my course **Numerical Analysis** 2018-B.  
Numerical Analysis is part of the Master Degree program in Science (Mathematical Engineering) of the *Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro*. The code of this course is in **Fortran77** (definitely not a *state of the art* programing language).  

Before you start follow the brief instructions to start coding in Fortan77 depending on your operative system (OS)  
## Fortran77
### Fortran 77 for Windows 10
*  Download and install [Force2.0](http://force.lepsch.com/p/download.html). Follow the wizard instructions.
* Execute Force 2.0, code and clic on the green arrow to run your program. 

### Fortran77 for Mac OS  Sierra  
* Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* Download and install [Command Tools Tools for Xcode.](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools
)
* Download and install [GNU Compiler Colletion](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS).
* Use your favorite text editor to start code Fortran77 programs and compile from the *Terminal* using  `gfortran [your file name]`. This should create an **a.out** file. Execute it from *Terminal* with `./a.out`

Hope will help you!
